## Welcome to Songs 2 Sing

Lean on me,

When you're not wrong,

And you need a friend.

Someone to share the throne.
<br />
<br />
Lean on me,

What's a warning?

What's an error?

It's all red text to meeeeee.


### Where You Are

Jordan,

Make way, make way,

Jordan it's time you knew,

the GDP client team is all you need,



Your engineers are programming,

they write to a JIRA board,

who needs agility, process is all you need.



This tradition is our mission,

and Jordan there's so much to do,

don't trip on the JIRA stories,

that's all you need.



We share everything we make,

each day at our hour standups,

our engineers sit on the couch and sigh,



I wanna see,



Don't walk away,

Jordan, stay on the ground now,

our team will need a leader,

and there Luke is.



There comes a day,

when you're gonna look around

and realize happiness is not

where you are



Consider the GTM,

consider his dreams,

the ideas of the GTM are all we need,



We make our agents for customers,

we deprecate our SDKS,

we unify our visualizations,

we take all the whisper data,



Consider the GTM,

his vision and dreams,

the ideas of the GTM are all we need,



And then you leave



That's right, you go

the team's safe and well provided

and when we look to the future

there Luke is



You'll be okay

in time you'll learn just as I did

you must find happiness on

an incubation team
