### Lean on Me

Lean on me,

When you're not wrong,

And you need a friend.

Someone to share the throne.
<br />
<br />
Lean on me,

What's a warning?

What's an error?

It's all red text to meeeeee.


### Where You Are

Jordan,

Make way, make way,

Jordan it's time you knew,

the GDP client team is all you need,

<br />
<br />

Your engineers are programming,

they write to a JIRA board,

who needs agility, process is all you need.

<br />
<br />

This tradition is our mission,

and Jordan there's so much to do,

don't trip on the JIRA stories,

that's all you need.

<br />
<br />

We share everything we make,

each day at our hour standups,

our engineers sit on the couch and sigh,

<br />
<br />

I wanna see,

<br />
<br />

Don't walk away,

Jordan, stay on the ground now,

our team will need a leader,

and there Luke is.

<br />
<br />

There comes a day,

when you're gonna look around

and realize happiness is not

where you are

<br />
<br />

Consider the GTM,

consider his dreams,

the ideas of the GTM are all we need,

<br />
<br />

We make our agents for customers,

we deprecate our SDKS,

we unify our visualizations,

we take all the whisper data,

<br />
<br />

Consider the GTM,

his vision and dreams,

the ideas of the GTM are all we need,

<br />
<br />

And then you leave

<br />
<br />

That's right, you go

the team's safe and well provided

and when we look to the future

there Luke is

<br />
<br />

You'll be okay

in time you'll learn just as I did

you must find happiness on

an incubation team
